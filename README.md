## Homeworks:
* ### __Set 1__ [Due by 3.5]: 
  * Register on Github.com and let TA know your ID. Give your full name in your profile.
  * Accept invitation to `2017.TQF-ML` team from TA
  * Install Python Aanconda and Github Desktop. Clone [PHBS/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition](https://github.com/PHBS/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition) and run `code/ch01/ch01.ipynb`  Send screenshots to TA
* ### __Set 2__ [Due by 3.29]
  * Create your own GitHub repository for homework `GITHUB_ID/PHBS_TQFML` (make sure to make it __public__)
  * Bank Marketing Data Set: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing), [Download](files/DataSet1)
  * Write a Jupyter notebook `GITHUB_ID/PHBS_TQFML/HW/bank_marketing.ipynb`:
    * load data (`bank.csv`, smaller sample), normalize, and devide training/test sets
    * randomly select 2 or 3 features
    * apply the methods covered in Ch. 3 with SK-learn (logistic regress, SVM, decision tree, etc)
    * check the accuracy and plot the outcome
    * repeat above to find better feature
    * commit the best result and don't foget to `sync` to the repository

## Course overview

The purpose of Topics in Quantitative Finance is to introduce students to recent trends and advanced research topics in quantitative methods of business and finance. This year’s course is dedicated to machine learning (ML) for finance. ML has been one of the hottest technology in software engineering. This course will explore the possibility of applying ML to finance and business. The course will give students the basic ideas and intuition behind the popular ML methods and hands-on experience of using ML software package such as SK-learn and Tensorflow (Google). Each student is required to complete a final course project.

## Prerequisites

There is no formal prerequisites. However, undergraduate-level knowledge in probability/statistics and previous experience in programming language is highly recommended.
